Mastermind - The Odin Project

Creating the popular game Mastermind in ruby as part of The Odin Project.
Full description of task available at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-mastermind


Game is complete to a minimum standard. 

However the code is a mess.  I over-thought it to begin with and made things more complex than they need to be.
There is code in mastermind.rb that should be in code.rb, the peg class probably doesnt need to exist, could just be methods in code.rb
I may come back and tidy these up or possibly start project again from scratch and this time plan it out properly.
